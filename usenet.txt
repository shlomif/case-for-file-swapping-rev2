With all the latest noise about Internet files sharing and downloading,
(and the various legal activity that was attempted against file swapping
resources) some people forget to ask the obvious question: is it actually a
bad thing to do? Some people, including some of those who trade songs,
erroneously believe that file swapping is unethical or even immoral, yet this
is not the case.

I wrote the essay "The Case for File Swapping" to explain why file
swapping is ethical and moral and why it should be legal:

It contains a "what I can do to further the cause" section:
