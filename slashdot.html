There's <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">an
    essay I wrote titled "The Case for File Swapping"</a> about why file swapping is ethical and moral and why it should be legal, which also touches on many other related issues in the fight for-and-against file sharing and downloading. It can provide a lot of fuel for all the people who either claim it's illegal, or are trying to prosecute the file sharers or the file sharing sites.

<p>
The essay deals with several misleading terms like "Intellectual Property",
"Theft/Stealing" of conent, and "Crime" in the meaning of violating the law,
and explains why accepting them prevents a clear thought on the matter. 
Afterwards, it explains why File sharing should be legal, and refutes the
claims that it hurts media sales, and the profitability of media companies
and artists. Afterwards, the essay refutes common claims against making
file sharing legal. It discusses ways in which one can contribute, and explains
why file swapping cannot be fully prevented, and also discusses several other
related topics.
