The Case for File Swapping
==========================

1. Introduction
---------------

* File swapping should be legal.
* It is ethical and moral.
* I'll explain why.

2. Some misleading terms
------------------------

* "Intellectual Property".

* "Stealing" or "Theft"
    - getting hold of a private data - real stealing (of property).
    - using someone else's copyrighted work in a one's work while claiming it 
    is one's own.
    
* "Piracy"

* "Crime"
    - People who violate the letter of the law are not necessarily criminals.
    - Example: People who protected Jews during the Nazi Reign.
    - Example: People who bought Alcohol during the "Dry Period".

* Conclusion:
    - re-iterating these wrong inflections time and again.

3. Why File Swapping should be Legal
------------------------------------

* It's not a crime
    - pointing to a copyrighted file is merely linking or referencing
    - a work that was put into the public cannot be restricted from
    further non-commercial distribution. The Laws that say so are unethical.

* There are plenty of other ways in which media vendors can make money.
    - Restricting commercial use.
    - Restricting modification or derivation.
    - requiring attribution
        >>> All respected by the Creative Commons licenses.

* File swapping does not hurt Media sales.
    - Bring Evidence.

* Media vendors hunt file swappers and prosecute them.
    - Lots of terror
    - What is it good for?
    - the RMS' "sharing" case. ("No, Tommy, don't share your media...")

* Put it into perspective.
    - The Media companies make money off selling people entertainment.
    - They don't save lives.
    - Even if noone pays for music/video/etc. (very unlikely), the rest of the 
    economy will still operate pretty darn well.

4. Refuting Common Arguments against File Swapping
--------------------------------------------------

* The Domino Effect.
* Civil disobedience - violating laws may cause anarchy.
* Comparison to not obeying traffic laws.
* Others

5. Legal Uses of File Swapping
------------------------------

* Getting a file from a misplaced CD.

* Getting the video clip of a song.

* Try before you buy.

* Sharing songs that are perfectly legal for distribution.

* Getting a digital recording of a song that was bought on cassete
or on a vinnyl record.

6. Reflection on Online Music Stores
------------------------------------

* A good thing.

* DRM's offer only figleaf protection and only attempt to deprive users of
the media they purchased.

* Still don't imply that P2P/Websites/etc. are bad.

7. Conclusion
-------------

* File swapping should be legal.

* Media companies will be better off accepting it and living with the fact.
    - "I Feel much Better - Now that I've Given Up All Hope"

* If they try to fight P2P by lawsuits and threats they should be fought
back.

8. Other Important Copyright Issues
-----------------------------------

* Circumvention Devices (DeCSS, etc.)

* Lengthening the Copyright Term.

* DMCA - Cory Doctorow's Essay.

Updates for 10-Jul-2006:
------------------------

+ * Style over content fallacy for the examples for benevolent fellons.

+ * The Internet as an alternative medium for content distribution:
  +  - By type:
        +- Music
        +    - GarageBand.com
        +    - ccMixter.
        +    - Web-sites/Torrents.
        +    - magnatune.
        +- Text
        +    - Wikis (Wikipedia and friends).
        +    - web-sites/torrents
        +    - blogs and blog comments
        +- Images
        +    - De-facto freely distributable, and to a slightly lesser extent
        +    modifiable.
        +   - Images Search Engines.
        +   - Flickr.com, etc.
        +- Videos and Animations.
        +    - Flash/SVG
        +    - Web-sites/torrents
        +    - Google Video
        +    - YouTube.com
        +    - Etc.
    +- The value of linking.
    +    - by using a hyperlink one can immediately enjoy and experience the
    +    piece of content. (Give some examples). 
    +        - Link to Paul Graham's "Web 2.0" and "What business can learn
    +        from Open Source".
    
* An email that told me that most documents about file swapping on the web
were against file swapping rather than for it.

+* Historical Perspective.
+    - Texts in ancient times.
+        - Very costy to duplicate.
+        - Authors encouraged people to copy, quote and re-use their text.
+    - After the invention of Paper and the Press.
+        - Commercial Books
+            - Copyright was invented to:
+                1. Protect artists so their works will not be re-printed
+                by publishers and prints.
+                2. Make sure other prints won't be able to re-print the
+                works of other publishers.
+            - Applied exclusively to written works. (not to recordings (which
+            did not exist yet), melodies, pictures, videos, etc.)

+ * Link to open-dot-dot-dot.

+ * Link to Wil Wheaton's Interview.

+ * "Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor."
+     - Robin Hood - stole from the exploiters and gave to the exploited.
+     - Not really true.
+     - Explain about the music distributors.

+ * The Golden Rule.
